Typical workflow for adding a new dictionary, e.g. for xy language:

1. Prepare file e.g. words.txt containing decent words to be guessed.
   Suggested format is UTF-8, one 5-letter word per line. The words
   don't have to be sorted, extra spaces or emply lines are fine.
2. Prepare another file e.g. xwords.txt in the same format, containing
   not-so-decent words that will be allowed as guess words (but will
   never be the answer).
3. Choose a single-byte encoding for your language, e.g. windows-1232
4. make -C tools
5. mkdir data/xy
6. cd data/xy
7. Create language.json for your language based on one of the examples
8. ../../tools/wordle-tool <path to words.txt> windows-1252
9. ../../tools/wordle-tool -x <path to xwords.txt> windows-1252

The last two steps generate words and xwords files. Now you can copy
the contents of data/xy directory to /usr/share/harbour-wordle/data/xy
on the device. Restart the app, your language should appear in the list
of dictionaries in the Settings view.
